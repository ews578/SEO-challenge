# SEO-challenge
For Challenge 1 of our bootcamp, I was assigned to debug a webpage and to make sure the html semantics are proper and the css aligns with the semantics given. This is important for a website to flow smoothly with no errors so the user can engage and acquire the content the user came to obtain. 

As a web developer it is important for me to understand the baseline of html and css as it will be applied in multiple situations throughout my career.

Attached is screenshot of the website in live form.
